# Unsaid

> A quiet place for things never said out loud.

## 🖤 About

**Unsaid** is a minimalist, introvert-focused anonymous thoughts wall built to let users express thoughts they usually keep to themselves. The project emphasizes calm visuals, subtle motion, and complete user control — no accounts, no backend, no data collection.

Thoughts are stored locally in the browser, so they persist across refreshes and sessions and can be deleted only by the user.
